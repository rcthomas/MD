This is a simple multi-dimensional array class template written in C++11.
The main annoyance is that you have to use braced-init-lists when calling
the constructor or using the multi-dimensional indexing.  That is not too
bad I guess.  If I am smart enough I will probably figure out how to make
that go away.

I will be working on this more.
